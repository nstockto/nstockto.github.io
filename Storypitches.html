<h1>Pitch 1: The Eye on the Storms<h2>
<p>As of yesterday, NOAA has been officially naming tropical storms for 60 years (Welcome to America, Andrea!). To commemorate six decades of Andrews, Isabels, Katrinas, Ritas,  Noras, Rogers, Irenes, and yes, even Sandys, Wired presents an interactive newsapp that lets users watch them as though they happened over a single season. </p>

<p>The map will include a slider bar, which will move from early May to late November. Sliding the bar will show 60 years worth of storms pummel the east coast. Each will be sized accordingly, and its tracks will follow its exact course.</p>

<p>The data is easy: NOAA already did the work for us, and even made it spreadsheet friendly. Their data includes 6 hour updates on every storm, with location data and windspeed included. This means the storms would move and morph smoothly as the users navigated through time. The actual icons for each storm can be as simple as circles that grow or shrink relative to their windspeed, to actual satellite imagery if we want to get fancy. Each storm will be labeled with its name and year, so viewers can easily compare storms. For famous or extra-destructive storms, we can add damage costs, death tolls, and other trivia. Curious viewers could access this info by hovering their mouse over a particular storm's icon.</p>

<p>This newsapp is an evergreen news source. As the season carries on, viewers would come check on how each storm compares historically. It can also be updated with new storms (as they happen), better graphics (as I need them), and more features (as I think of them). </p>

<p>Data is freely available through NOAA's Hurdat archives. </p>


<h1>Pitch 2: Growing pains</h1>

<p>2005 was a big year for Texas corn-growers. For the first time, they could use herbicide-resistant, genetically-modified corn. The GM breeds were popular, and soon over forty percent of all Texas corn was herb-resistant. This was over twice the national average. In the past seven years, Texas' GM corn usage has steadily declined to half of what it once was. Compared to Texas, most other states' herbicide-resistant GM corn usage started low, grew moderately, and if it fluctuated, did so slightly.  Why did Texas start so strong with GM products, and did it drop so sharply? 

<p>In my research of the Texas State Law Library, I found no change to the legal status of GM corn. This is a straight news story, with a historical angle based on USDA data about implementation and use of GM products by state. </p>
